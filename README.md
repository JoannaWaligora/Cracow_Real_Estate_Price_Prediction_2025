# Cracow Real Estate Price Prediction 2025
The project aims to create the best model for predicting apartment prices in Krakow. Apartment features were downloaded in May 2025. The project was divided into three parts:
## • Flats_scraping.ipynb - scraping data from the gratka.pl portal
The data was downloaded in May 2025 from the popular Polish apartment portal gratka.pl and then saved to the flats_set1.csv file
## • Flats_feature_engineering.ipynb - feature engineering
All columns were analyzed for significance and missing values. Unnecessary columns were removed. Additional, relevant columns were created based on existing features.
## • Models_results.ipynb - project section: models and conclusions
In the project section, five models were created: Linear regression, Logistic regression, ElasticNet, Decision Tree Regressor, and Random Forest Regressor. The Random Forest Regressor model proved to be the best model. The file presents a comparison of the models and conclusions about the data and the best model created.
